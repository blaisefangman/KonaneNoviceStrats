# KonaneNoviceStrats
Generates heuristics for novice Konane players.

Maybe someday I'll add command line options, but currently you have to edit the python scripts to change parameters.

deap_konane.py evolves a population of heuristics to match the 3 db files.

simulate_konane.py uses a heuristic agent to play against other computational agents. Currently, heuristic weights must be hardcoded into this file, and two examples are available.
